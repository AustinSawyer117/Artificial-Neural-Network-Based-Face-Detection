#Abstract—This project aims to implement the functional task of detecting upright, frontal face in the images by using the artificial neural network. The face detection system we have implemented based on a previously-trained neural network. The objective image was firstly divided into lots of sub-windows, which would be pre-processed, and each of those window went through the trained neural network to make a judgment whether each sub-window contains a face; then the system would arbitrates among the sub-windows in order to converge the overlapping detected faces. A retinal connection to the neural networks would be biologically motivated and presented. We chose the different components of the training set to evaluate the development of the system.
Keywords—Face detection; computer vision; artificial neural networks, machine learning.
